# TodoList
## BackGround:
created a TODO LIST program in C++ using hash table. This was inspired by JIRA. Users can add task, change the task name, add priority to the task, change task priority, etc. Once the user closes the program (by pressing 8) the program will log the completetion percentage for that day in a text file. This way users can see productive they were through out the day, the week, or even through out the year. 

## How to run:
1. ensure C++ is installed on local machine (can verify via typing gcc in VSC terminal or CMD)
2. compile with the following code `g++ -std=c++17 .\hashTask.cpp` or `g++ -std=c++17 .\hashTask.cpp -o <give it a name>`
3. run `./a` `for g++ -std=c++17 .\hashTask.cpp` or `./givename` for `g++ -std=c++17 .\hashTask.cpp -o <give it a name>`
4. Follow prompt and enjoy
